## üìã Project Overview

This project is a self-contained single-page web application created to demonstrate the capabilities of in-browser machine learning for business forecasting. It showcases a workflow for data analysis, model training, and forecasting for the **DSM8H 50.0HP MOTOR SS TURBO** product.

The entire machine learning process is executed on the client-side using JavaScript and TensorFlow.js.

## üåü Key Features

* **Interactive UI:** A step-by-step interface that guides a user through the forecasting process.
* **Historical Data Visualization:** Uses **Chart.js** to render responsive line charts comparing sales data.
* **In-Browser ML Model Training:** Trains a Neural Network using **TensorFlow.js** on historical data.
* **Dynamic Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays key business and ML model metrics.
* **12-Month Sales Forecasting:** Uses the trained model to predict sales for the next 12 months.
* **Business Insights:** Automatically generates insights based on the analysis and forecast.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Workflow

The application follows a logical sequence from data preparation to forecasting.

1.  **Data Preparation:** Historical sales data is normalized using a min-max scaling function to prepare it for the neural network.
2.  **Model Architecture:** A sequential neural network is defined using `tf.sequential()` with multiple Dense and Dropout layers. It uses a sliding window of 3 months of data to predict the 4th month.
3.  **Training:** The model is compiled with the `adam` optimizer and `meanSquaredError` loss function. It is then trained for 100 epochs.
4.  **Forecasting:** The model predicts the next 12 months iteratively. The output is then denormalized and adjusted with simple business logic to produce the final forecast.
